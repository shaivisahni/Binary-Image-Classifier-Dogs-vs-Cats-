# Dog vs Cat Image Classifier

This project is a simple image classification tool that uses PyTorch and a pre-trained ResNet18 model to classify images of dogs and cats. It was created to demonstrate my ability to build and train deep learning models using PyTorch.

## Features

- Binary classification of cat vs. dog images
- Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet18 model from torchvision
- Fine-tuned on a small custom dataset
- Reports training loss per epoch

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyTorch
- torchvision

Install dependencies:


## Running the Project

Run the classifier using: python3 dog_vs_cat_classifier.py

## Sample output:

Epoch 1 Loss: 0.9974
Epoch 2 Loss: 0.0745
Epoch 3 Loss: 0.0170

## Notes
- The dataset is small and only for demonstration purposes.
- The model trains for 3 epochs by default.
- It can be improved by adding more labeled images under data/train and data/val.
